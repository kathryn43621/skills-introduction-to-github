## Hello, I'm Kathryn Yang 👋

I'm a full stack software engineer with a passion for improving lives through technology, healthcare, and accessibility.

### 💼 Background

- **Occupational Therapy:** My journey began as an Occupational Therapist, where I had the privilege of working closely with individuals facing various challenges, inculding disabilities and mental health issues. The journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of user needs and accessible principles. I prioritise creating client-centred solutions that enhance the user experience and promote well-being through accessible technology.

- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** My commitment to inclusivity and accessibility led me to specialise in accessibility solutions. With an understanding of the profound impact that accessibility has on people's lives, I specialise in crafting client-centered approaches that cater to individuals with diverse abilities, ensuring that digital and physical environments are welcoming to everyone.

- **Innovation in Healthcare:** I'm passionate about leveraging design thinking to innovate within the healthcare sector. I've been involved in projects that reimagine healthcare experiences, from patient interfaces to assistive technologies.

- **Software Engineering:** Recognising the transformative power of technology, I ventured into Software Engineering. This transition allowed me to combine my healthcare and accessibility expertise with my programming skills. I've had the privilege of working on projects that bridge the gap between healthcare, technology, and accessibility, striving to make a positive impact on people facing challenges.

### 🚀 Future Focus

As I look ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and accessibility. I aspire to continue developing innovative solutions that empower individuals, enhance accessibility, and improve healthcare outcomes. My goal is to create positive change through meaningful work and collaboration.
